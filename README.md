Create a dynamic tkinter background gradient. 


based on this stack overflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32530345/pil-generating-vertical-gradient-image/32532502#32532502

mainly I want to have this available when I try to create more dynamic tkinter displays.

feel free to do whatever you want with it, maybe even make tkinter do moderner graphics.
